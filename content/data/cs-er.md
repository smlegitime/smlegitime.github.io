## Abstract

While researchers and educators have endeavored to explore ways to introduce data science and artificial intelligence (DS&AI) concepts into K-12 education, accessibility to such courses is unequal among urban schools. To address this disparity and harness the reciprocal advantages for integrating computer science concepts into science lessons, we aimed to support high school science teachers in guiding students to apply science ideas and DS&AI technology to address social problems in science lessons. In this way, more students will be able to have access to DS&AI and related computer science concepts, as well as use those concepts as additional tools for engaging in science learning that seeks social transformation to address current and future challenges. In this presentation, we will share a planning tool for an integrating DS&AI science module and two lessons we designed using the template. We will also illustrate how we piloted and refined one of the lessons, including assessment of the lesson using data collected from student artifacts. Subsequent modifications we made and the effects observed from re-implementation of the lesson after refinement will be presented as well.
